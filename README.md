# Pomodoro Timer Project

## What is a pomodoro timer?

A pomodoro timer is a timer that helps the user maintain productivity by having set amounts of work time and break time than run concurrently to each other. 
By maintaining this flow, productivity naturally improves by not overworking your brain in a single sitting

## How does the project work?

The project uses the useEffect Hook to create a timer that, when reaches 0, plays a sound and starts the other timer automatically. The project is built using React,
which allows the screen to be refreshed every time the timer changes.
